## Development Steps

1. `README.md`: Complete revamp with enhanced documentation
   - Added ASCII art logo and visual elements (badges, emojis)
   - Created detailed architecture diagram showing component relationships
   - Expanded feature descriptions with categorized capabilities
   - Added comprehensive project structure visualization
   - Enhanced installation and usage instructions
   - Added future directions section

2. `.ai-clean/`: Created personal-context-free version of .ai directory
   - Removed all personal context and timestamps
   - Preserved core structure and functionality files
   - Sanitized usernames and personal references
   - Created compressed archive (ai-clean.tar.gz) for distribution

3. Executed end-of-session procedures
   - Generated timestamp-based EOD status file
   - Updated with fact-checked UTC timestamps
   - Properly documented session activities and next steps

## Key Decisions

- Adopted a more visually appealing README format with ASCII art and badges
- Created a distributable version of the .ai directory without personal context
- Highlighted the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a key differentiator in the project
- Emphasized the containerized approach to code generation as the core innovation

## Next Steps

1. Implement multi-language support beyond Go
2. Create integration examples with popular IDEs
3. Develop automated testing framework for the code generation pipeline
4. Expand MCP rules for additional programming languages
5. Create user documentation for the .ai tooling system

Progress: Completed major documentation improvements and created a shareable version of the .ai tooling system. Next session will focus on expanding the core functionality to support additional programming languages.
