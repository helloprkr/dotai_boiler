# AI Session Status

This directory contains status reports from completed AI sessions. These status files document progress, decisions, learnings, and next steps from development sessions, providing continuity across the development lifecycle.

## Purpose

Status files serve multiple important purposes:

1. **Knowledge Persistence**: Preserve context and decisions across sessions
2. **Progress Tracking**: Document completed tasks and next steps
3. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand project history
4. **Learning Repository**: Capture insights gained during development
5. **Decision Record**: Document and explain technical decisions

## Status File Format

Status files follow a standard format based on the end-session template:

```
# Session: [Session Name]

## Session Summary
- Project: [Project Name]
- Task: [Task Description]
- Date: [Session Date]

## Accomplishments
- [Major accomplishment 1]
- [Major accomplishment 2]
- [Additional accomplishments]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

## Code Changes
- [Files modified and created]

## Issues and Challenges
- [Resolved issues]
- [Pending issues]

## Learnings
- [Key learnings]

## Next Steps
- [Immediate next steps]
- [Future work]
```

## Referencing Status Files

To reference a status file in a new AI session:

```
@import .ai/status/YYYY-MM-DD-[task-name].md
```

This provides the AI assistant with context about previous work on the same feature or component.

## Best Practices

1. **Create status files at the end of each significant session**
2. **Use descriptive filenames** including date and feature/task name
3. **Document key decisions** with their rationale
4. **List specific next steps** for future sessions
5. **Flag potential codex entries** to document important learnings
6. **Include links to relevant resources** discovered during the session
7. **Note any pending issues** that need further investigation

# Session: Authentication System Implementation

## Session Summary
- Project: E-commerce Platform
- Task: Implement user authentication with JWT
- Date: 2023-10-15

## Accomplishments
- Created user model with password hashing
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Added login and register API endpoints
- Created basic authentication middleware

## Decisions Made
- Used bcrypt for password hashing: Industry standard with good security/performance balance
- Set JWT expiry to 24 hours: Balances security with user convenience
- Stored refresh tokens in database: Allows for token revocation
- Added rate limiting on auth routes: Prevents brute force attacks

## Code Changes
- Created: src/models/User.ts
- Created: src/controllers/authController.ts
- Created: src/middleware/auth.ts
- Modified: src/routes/index.ts
- Modified: src/app.ts

## Issues and Challenges
- Resolved: Token validation error was due to incorrect secret key reference
- Pending: Need to implement password reset functionality
- Pending: Social login integration needs further research

## Learnings
- JWT verification requires proper error handling for different failure modes
- Storing sensitive data like tokens requires consideration of database encryption
- Rate limiting is essential for authentication routes to prevent attacks

## Next Steps
1. Implement password reset functionality
2. Add email verification for new accounts
3. Research and implement social login options
4. Write authentication system tests
