# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for defining consistent interaction patterns between AI models and development environments. It enables AI assistants to understand context, apply best practices, generate appropriate code, and maintain consistency across different interactions.

## Purpose

MCP solves several key challenges in AI-assisted development:

1. **Context Awareness**: Helps AI models understand the specific context in which they're operating
2. **Consistency**: Ensures recommendations follow established patterns and practices
3. **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains knowledge between sessions
4. **Behavioral Guidance**: Shapes AI behavior to align with project requirements

## Core Components

### Rules

Rules define specific patterns, contexts, and explanations for AI models to follow:

```
@rule rule_name {
  context: "description of when this rule applies",
  pattern: "example pattern or code structure",
  explanation: "explanation of why this pattern is recommended"
}
```

### Tags

Tags provide metadata about rules and help organize them:

```
@tag tag_name {
  description: "description of what this tag represents",
  rules: [rule1, rule2, rule3]
}
```

### Contexts

Contexts define specific development environments or scenarios:

```
@context context_name {
  description: "description of this context",
  rules: [rule1, rule2, rule3]
}
```

## How to Use MCP

### Defining Rules

Create rule files for specific technologies or patterns:

```
// .ai/rules/typescript/functions.mcp
@rule typescript_function_naming {
  context: "TypeScript function naming conventions",
  pattern: "function camelCaseName() { ... }",
  explanation: "Functions should use camelCase naming"
}
```

### Referencing Rules in AI Sessions

Include rule files in your AI conversations:

```
@import .ai/rules/typescript/functions.mcp
```

### Creating Custom Rules

1. Identify common patterns or best practices in your codebase
2. Create a new rule file in `.ai/rules/custom/`
3. Define rules using the MCP syntax
4. Reference these rules in your AI sessions

## Example MCP Files

### React Component Rules

```
// .ai/rules/react/components.mcp
@rule react_functional_component {
  context: "React component definition",
  pattern: "function ComponentName() { return <div>...</div>; }",
  explanation: "Use functional components as the default component type"
}

@rule react_prop_types {
  context: "React component props typing",
  pattern: "interface ComponentProps { prop1: string; prop2?: number; }",
  explanation: "Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces"
}
```

### Next.js API Rules

```
// .ai/rules/nextjs/api.mcp
@rule nextjs_api_handler {
  context: "Next.js API route handler",
  pattern: "export default async function handler(req, res) { ... }",
  explanation: "Use async function for API handlers to enable awaiting async operations"
}

@rule nextjs_api_response {
  context: "Next.js API response",
  pattern: "return res.status(200).json({ data });",
  explanation: "Always specify status code and return JSON responses"
}
```

## Benefits of MCP

1. **Consistency**: Ensures code follows established patterns
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on minor code corrections
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Captures and applies team expertise
4. **Onboarding**: Helps new developers understand project patterns
5. **Quality**: Improves overall code quality through consistent standards
